//! The library that underlies most things [lockbook](https://lockbook.net).
//!
//! All lockbook clients
//! (iOS, linux, etc) rely on this library to perform cryptography, offline edits, and
//! reconciliation of data between our server, other clients, and other devices.
//!
//! Our server relies on this library for checking signatures, and validating whether tree
//! modifications are valid / authorized.
//!
//! - Most clients / integrators will be interested in the functions attached to the [Lb] struct.
//!   See the [service] module for evolving this functionality.
//! - The [model] module contains the specification of our data structures and contracts between
//!   components.
//! - The [blocking] module contains blocking variants of all [Lb] functions for consumers without
//!   async runtimes.
//! - The [io] module contains interactions with disk and network.
